# Marginal Rigidity
## Introduction
### Principia Obscura
Mathematics is the most rigorous academic field among all there are. Once a proof of any theorem is carefully verified by mathematicians, it would remain forever a truth no matter what happens after. Every terminology has rigid meaning, crystal clear for every scholars. Each symbol is robust, well-defined and used exactly in the way it should be.
Unfortunately, this is correct only in Plato’s philosophical ideal world. In reality, there are several caveats that we must be aware of. Vocabularies and symbols have different meaning in different references, and some are used highly incautiously. Most working mathematicians are quite busy using their intuitions for their research. They take formalization of the results into little concern. Expressing the mathematical formulae in strict sequences of strings is less important than the critical idea itself, they would say.
There is one field of mathematics that takes cumbersome philosophical details into account seriously: mathematical logic, also known as foundations of mathematics. Mathematical logicians are enthusiastic of stuffs like law of excluded middle, Godel’s incompleteness theorem or axiom of choice, which normal mathematicians do not take care of much. However, even they are not paranoid about the rigorousness of their reasonings. They are not machines that do the bothersome tasks for lazy mathematicians. Instead, they are working hard to develop creative ideas and prove theorems.
Well, I am paranoid about the rigidity of mathematics. I consider that currently mathematics is poorly formalized, contrary to reasonable expectation of some. So this short book will try to reduce obscure principles of mathematics as much as possible.
### Infinite Regress
I do not try here to define every mathematical vocabulary. We always need to use other words to define a word. No word can be defined from nothingness. Also I do not try to describe all mathematical contents in one unified formal system. For example, (A->B) and (B->C) makes (A->C), which is modus ponens (MP). However, we cannot describe MP as a rule in the system. This issue is described well in ‘Godel, Escher, Bach’. To deal with it, meta-system should be used. I also do not to eradicate every philosophical issues.
We should avoid infinite regress. I try to increase the rigidity of mathematics only marginally. This is why the title is ‘Marginal Rigidity’, not total or complete rigidity.
